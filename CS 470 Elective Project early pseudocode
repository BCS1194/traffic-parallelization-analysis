 * Traffic will be represented with roads and nodes (cars). Roads have an associated cost
 * value wich is determined primarily by the time it takes to travel from the origin point
 * to the destination point on that road. Travel time is determined by the number of cars
 * traveling on that road at a given time, as well as the measure of distance of that road.
